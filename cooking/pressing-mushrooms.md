# Pressing mushrooms
When cooking mushrooms you can press them with another pan on top.
That is going to squeeze out the water, reduces the cooking time and makes it possible to make them become crispy.

## Pressing Technique
Don't press immediatly as the mushrooms are too hard at the beginning.
Pushing immediatly will cause them to break. The goal is to squeeze the water out.

Put the pan on top at first without pressing.
After they softened up a bit use a towel to press down the pan on top.
Increase the weight little by little.
That process might take 1-2 minutes.
They are ready when they are ~50% smaller than before.
