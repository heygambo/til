# TIL

> Today I Learned

Inspired by [jbranchaud/til](https://github.com/jbranchaud/til).

A collection of things I've learned during my day to day work.

Most of them will probably be small learnings.

They might be things that I've looked up a million times that never make the way into my brain.
